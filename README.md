# Traffic_Analysis
The goal of our analysis id to determine indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94. 
In this project we will be practicing data visualization using a dataset created by John Hogue and can be found as the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume). The dataset contains data of westbound traffic on the [I-94 Interstate Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94), the data was recorded at a station located between __Minneapolis__ and __Saint Paul__.

The goal of our analysis id to determine indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94. These indicators can be the weather type, time of day or day of the week.
